# Website skeleton

This is the base of my website. Feel free to use it for your own website if you want an easy way to setup a static Jekyll blog.

## Favicon

You will probably want to generate all your own favicons and place them in the `_assets/images/favicon` directory. I recommend using [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).
